# THA-3: Investigation into the Correlation between Hate Groups in the US and Mass Shootings

## Research Question: Is there a correlation between the location of mass shootings in the US and the location of hate groups?
- This research is limited to two open-sourced datasets - both imported from [Enigma Public](https://public.enigma.com)
- As such, there are many variables that are not analyzed. My goal is not to show if hate groups do or do not lead to mass shootings, but to determine if the instances of mass shootings increase or decrease with the number of hate groups in close proximity (ie. are there clusters of hateful influences in certain areas that have proportionally more mass shootings or not)
